<p> Welcome to our website. We are computer science majors and this is our senior project. We are 
crurrently attending FMU and we also have musical backgrounds. Dianna plays the flute and Skyler 
plays the clarinet. The goal of our website is to teach people with little to no knowadge of
playing a instrument or reading/ understanding sheet music and teach them the basic fundamentals
of musical theory. This website contains mini games, vocbulary words, flash cards and other 
interactional things to teach you how to read music notes in treble and bass cleft. You will learn 
the differenrce between categories of instrumants.</p>
